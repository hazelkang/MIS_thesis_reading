    [Job Hopping, Information Technology Spillovers, and Productivity Growth]
    
    1. Intro and Keywords
-movement of information technology workers among firms
-use employee microdata. online resume database. model IT workers' mobility patterns 
-Hypothesis: IT investments of other firms generage productivity spillovers through IT labor flows among firms

    2. Empirical Framework
-estimate how R&D spillovers affect productivity of IT investments 
-capital(K) and labor(L) to output / computer investment(C) 
 computer investment by other firms within the network defined by spillover transmission mechanism(S)
-challenge is the development of reliable measures of relevant internal/external IT investments for each firm
-measure external pools of know-how
-relied on the assumption that firms benefit from knowledge of other firms when they are 'close'
-measure amount of leakage btw two firms with weights btw two firms
-T: R&D capital stock or R&D intensity 
-hypothesis transfer of IT-related knowledge occurs through mobility of workers 
: measure of proximity is the actual flow of IT labor 

    3. Data
 -IT labor mobility data: from leading website through which participants post employment histories online
 -employment info for about 10 million users who posted or modified their career information about occupation
 -educational distribution of workers in the sample is similar to that of IT workers in Current Population Survey (CPS) data
 -population of interest is job-switching IT worker; weighted toward younger workers and job hoppers
 -employer names matched with publicly listed companies including Compustat 
 -IT investment
 1) IT capital stock from Computer Intelligence Technology Database 
 -restricted to Fortune 1,000 firms 
 -no longer includes direct IT capital stock measures
 2) supplement IT capital stock with IT employment measures based on IT labor database 
 3) External IT pool
 : IT intensity of other firms weighted by share of incoming IT labor hired from that firm in a given year

 -y: value added
 -x: Labor
