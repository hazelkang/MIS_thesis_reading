  #Data
-book characteristic: amazon, bn 
-sales: approximated by collecting random sample of 3578 books from Global Books in Print released over 1998-2002
& 2818 titles appeared in Publishers Weekely best-seller lists from 1991-2002
-period of data collection: 2-day period in May 2003, 2-day period in August 2003, 2-day period in May 2004
-price charged, promised time until book would ship, number of reviews, avg number of stars reviewers assigned
-for all periods, extracted most recent 500 reviews of book posted on Web 
(Data characteristic)
1) Prices significantly higher in bn than amazon
2) Amazon has more reviews than bn, much more books have no reviews in bn
3) Reviews slightly more positive on avg at bn 
-Number of incremental reviews: btw May 2003~July 2003 / btw May 2003~April 2004 (11-month period)

  #Model
-y: log rank (in lieu of log sales), difference between log ranking of book on Amazon and BN
-log specification estimates the effect of a change in independent variables on percentage change in dependent variable
-book fixed effect: offline promotion, quality of book, popularity of author etc.
-S: dummy variables of shippint times promised by each Web site for each book 

  #Results
-on average, reviews have positive effect on sales (esp at bn) 
-addition of new, favorable reviews at one site results in increase in sales of a book at that site relative to the other site
1) Cross-sectional
-assume no site-specific fixed effects / 2 sites identical in readership's preferences
-y: log(rank of Amazon)-log(rank of BN)
-include length of reviews : positive/significant at Amazon / negative/insignificant at BN
-> interpretation: encouraging longer, more useful reviews harmful to sales / longer reviews don't stimulate sales
$ only took in length, didn't take in content. 
2) DID Analysis
-assume site-specific fixed effect, there is difference in 2 site's readership's preferences
-analysis with books available at both sites (2082 books) / smaller sample than (1)
-effect of two month & one year changes in reviews on changes in sales
-y: change(log(rank of Amazon)-log(rank of BN))

*5-star reviews/avg star rating increase sales, 1-star reviews decrease sales
*1-star reviews have greater impact(coeeficient) than 5-star reviews 

#extension
-examine whether improving customer's satisfaction wih his purchases affects subsequent loyalty
