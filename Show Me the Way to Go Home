  [Show Me the Way to Go Home: An Empirical Investigation of Ride-Sharing and Alcohol Related Motor Vehicle Fatalities]

  1. Intro
-entry of ride-sharing services influences rate of alcohol related motor vehicle fatalities
-potential for reducing instances of drunk driving 

  2. Data
-natural experiment : intro of ride-sharing btw 2009-2014
-California Highway Patrol's Statewide Integrated Traffic Report System (SWITRS)

  3. Hypothesis
1) Implementation of a premium ride-sharing service will be associated with a negative/significant effect on rate of alcohol related motor vehicle fatalities
2) Implementation of a discount ride-sharing service will be associated with a negative/significant effect on rate of alcohol related motor vehicle fatalities

  3. Empirical Model
-DID
-y: ln(Number of deaths) : number of people killed in motor vehice accident in town where at least one was under influence of alcohol
-x: Uber X(discount service), Uber Black(premium car service) entry 
-fixed effect

  4. Results
1) Entry of Uber X strongly/negatively affects number of motor vehicle fatalities 
2) Time for effects to manfiest is nontrivial(9~15 months) 
3) No effect of entry when surge pricing is likely 
4) No negative effect of entry on rate of non-alcohol related motor vehicle fatalities
