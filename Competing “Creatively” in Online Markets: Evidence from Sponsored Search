[Competing “Creatively” in Online Markets: Evidence from Sponsored Search]

   1. Intro
-firms’ differentiation strategies in these competitive markets or outcomes of differentiation
-competition among firms in online sponsored search markets
-test a model that predicts the clickthrough rate (CTR) of a seller’s listing in a sponsored search setting
-theorize that the CTR is jointly driven by the seller’s positioning strategy and the nature of competition around the focal seller’s listing

  2. Research Context
-integration and co-evolution of search and advertising business models
-clickthrough rate(CTR): defined by total number of clicks received by an ad divided by total number of time ad was shown
  -> measure of effectiveness of the ad in attracting consumers to the seller's website
-rank on a listing may change dynamically depending on the rank ordering of the current bids 
-research in economics and IS suggests that a consumer's search cost has significant impact on the price, product positioning, ad and other strategic decisions of a firm
  [Nature of consumer search]
1. Search intensity
: time and effort spent in searching 
2. Specific info sought 

  3. Hypothesis
H1: Sellers ranked higher in a sponsored search listing have higher CTR than those ranked lower in the search listing
H2a: The CTR of a seller in a sponsored search listing is influenced by the seller's positioning strategy as highlighted by the USP in its ad creative
  USP: Unique Selling Proposition (USP)
H2b: The effect of a seller's USP on CTR is moderated by the rank at which the seller appears on the sponsored search listing
H2c: The relative performance(CTR) of a price USP as compared to a quality USP improves at lower ranks in the sponsored search listing
H3a: In a sponsored search listing, higher competitive intensity for a USP will lead to lower CTR for a seller with that USP
H3b: Impact of competitive intensity is stronger for a seller using a quality USP relative to a seller using a price USP

  4. Data
-field experiment conducted in conjunction with a firm in the mortgage industry(FocalSeller) that bids for placement on one of the largest sponsored search markets
-bids for top 36 keywords, ranks obtained to each of the bids
-period of three months in 2006
-2 brand positioning strategies chosen: price and quality USP 
  1) Quality USP - customer satisfaction, trusted, secure and confidential, quick and easy
  2) Price USP - no closing cost, low rates, lowest price, low interest, compare offers
-measure competition: data on USP of competitors 

  5. Empirical model
-moderated multiple regression (MMR)
-y: CTR, number of clicks received by a seller / number of impressions received by the seller
-Rank: daily average
-USP: 1 for price, 0 for quality 
-CI: competitive intensity on the USP employed by the seller 

  6. Results
-magnitude of decrease in CTR as we move from top rank to bottom rank is much larger for the quality USP in comparison to price USP
-both firm's USP and competitive intensity have significant impact on performance
-price USP performs better than quality USP at lower ranks 

  7. Further research
-consumer survey to identify profile of consumers who search till the bottom of listing 

*Things to look for:
psychological search and economics of information (EOI) literatures
