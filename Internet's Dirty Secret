    $[Impact of Online Intermediaries on HIV transmission]$

  #Keyword notes (intro)
-STD: sexually transmitted diseases
-online personal ads site 
-10 year period: 1999-2008 across 33 states in US 
-non-market related casual sex is the primary driver of increase in HIV
-as online technology permeates society and personal lives
-presenting participants with key information regarding sexual encounters, facilitate matching of sex partners
-Natural experiment setup: during expansion, classified ad site available in certail locations at each time period
-address question whether HIV increase after Craiglist entry, due to more testing or more hookups

  #Lit review
-choose to have casual sex due to immediate gratification 
1. communication and exchanges not limited by spatial and temporal constraints 
2. search costs for searching causal partners reduced
3. variety of offerings broader 

 1) Can increase HIV by:
1. willing to have sex with strangers, little concern for HIV infection
2. More online seekers have sexual exposure to HIV positive, less worry of HIV 
3. Large proportion of HIV positive online users have unprotected sex


 2) Contributes to
1. impact of internet and information technologies on medical related outcomes
2. impact of matching platforms on market outcomes 

  #Data
-nationwide panel data for 33 US states 
-CL Entry timing for each state: Year, entry month 

*control variables: demo characteristics, socioeconomic factors, internet availability
 1. Age, ethnicity, population size (SEER)
-state demographics
-proportion figures for age group 20-39 (sexually active)
proportion of African Americans(ethnic groups) - control for patterns in sexual networks within and btw racial groups
population size: covariate to account for level of urbanization of each location 

 2. Education, househod income (US Census Bureau)
-yearly surveys on level of education, income 
-control for socioeconomic differences - resulting differential access to healthcare and info needed to avoid HIV

 3. Number of high speed lines connecting residential homes to internet(FCC) 
-control for accessiblity to sites

+survey data: HIV testing behavior (Behaviorial Risk Factor Surveillance System(BRFSS))
-calculate proportion of respondents who had HIV testing in past year during study period 
-to assess whether changes in testing behavior influence the trends observed in HIV incidence

  #Empirical Methodology
-exploitation exogenous variation in CL entry across states and years (natural experiment)
-allows comparison of difference in HIV incidence after/before site entry 
-state and year fixed effects: controls for time-invariant factors
-error terms clustered at the state level to account for autocorrelation in the data
-Negative Binomial: acount for count nature of HIV incidents 

 1. Robustness checks
1) exclude CL sites that extend across multiple counties (site entry occurs only once for each county)
-time-varying factors: include interaction term of state covariates and linear time trend 
-robustness: matched sample of obs derived from PSM 
-Binary year indicator for site entry: may not be captured well for states with site entry in later months
: robusness check - using measure of site activity (Avg daily number of personal posts) as a regressor in place of binary entry variable

2) Falsification Checks
-using regressions to predict incidence of non-sexually transmitted diseases
(infected animals, contaminated water sources)

3) confounding effect: increase in risky sexual behavior due to medical breakthroughs in HIV treatment
: Falsification test - placebo dummy variables - 2 years of pre-entry dummies, 4 years of post-entry dummies
 
4) Entry Exogeniety 
-increase in ind seeking casual sex, lead to increase in HIV, increase in requests to launch CL in their locations
-Variation in entry timing / location exogenous :
1. CL classified ads web made up of multiple sections 
: entry decisions not solely driven by demand for casual sex partners 
2. CL defrays costs by posting fees for ads - not based on demand for hook ups 

5) HIV inducing Mechanisms
-How CL usage leads to greater HIV levels? 
 1. Rise in HIV incidence induced by greater levels of HIV testing 
 (1) After sex online, get HIV tests - more HIV
 (2) Before sex online, need to get HIV test to qualify -> not actual increase in HIV from sexual acts by CL
To check for (2) 
-Regress HIV testing proportion on linear time trend
-Relationship btw site entry and HIV testing behavior 
-HIV testing proportion as covariate in main regression model 

 2. Mechanism that drives HiV trends by identifying type of casual sex solicited on CL
-non-market related casual sex, market related casual sex (monetary payments)
-CL 'personals' section, 'erotic services' - mostly market-related sex 
-avg count of erotic service ads, avg number of personal ads in place of entry variable 

  #Results
 1. Positive/significant effect of CL entry on HIV infection
Model 1) Binary, unweighted regression
Model 2) Binary, weighted regression
Model 3) Time-varying state factors w/ interaction term
Model 4) account for endogenous factors - Propensity score matching
Model 5) robustnesscheck - entry in last quarter (10-12) labeled as site entry in following year

Model 6-10) Negative Binomial 

 2. Falsification Tests
-Not transmitted through physical human contact diseases: not significant
-pre-entry & post-entry placebo variables: no significant effect on pre-entry, only after 2 years post-entry

 3. Mechanism
-CL usage leads to shift in HIV testing attitudes? - proportion of HiV testing regressed on CL entry
-> insignificant / general decreasing trend in HIV testing behavior 
-proportion of HIV testing as a regressor: insignificant effect on HIV infection level
-upward shift in HIV trends by ads in personals section
& negative shift in HIV trends by ads in erotic section: sex workers less risky behavior
