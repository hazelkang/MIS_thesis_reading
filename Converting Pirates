    [Converting Pirates without Cannibalizing Purchasers: The Impact of Digital Distribution on Physical Sales and Internet Piracy]
  
     #Intro/key words
 1-What happens to the level of piracy of television content when that content is removed from iTunes
(and when it is returned)?
 2-What happens to DVD sales of television seasons sold on the Internet when those seasons are removed from the iTunes store?
   -> restoring: negative/insignificant decrease in piracy 
   -> decision to remove content from iTunes leads to significant increase in pirated content 
   -> no change in demand for NBC's DVD content with NBC's closing/reopening at iTunes
   -shock of removing content from iTunes (NBC content from iTunes store) in Dec 2007
   
     #Theory
 *Digital Distribution and Piracy
 Why purchase through digital distribution channel if piracy is free?
 1) cost to learn to use BitTorrent : fixed cost
 2) individuals experience moral qualms about pirating 
 3) individuals fear being caught and punished
 4) Pirated downloads less convenient and lower quality compared to iTunes (legitimate consumption)
 
  #Data
-panel data on consumption of pirated TV content through major BitTorrent tracker sites
Minniova.org: search engine for torrent trackers 
-panel data on sales of DVD season box sets at Amazon.ocm 
Nov 18-Dec 15, 2008 : Amazon 90% share of online DVD sales 
Sales data - sales rank (Pareto distribution)
-program for NBC and non-NBC(ABC, CBS, Fox) as control 
-compare change 2 wks before/after removal(Dec 1, 2007)
-use of quasi-experiment: w/ shock of removal of content on Dec 1, 2007

-x: After 12/1 
-cluster SE at series level: since downloads of episodes within seasons or series may be correlated
2) Impact on DVD Sales
